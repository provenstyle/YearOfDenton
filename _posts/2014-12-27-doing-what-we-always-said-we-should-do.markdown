I have lived in Denton, Tx for eighteen and half years now.  I moved here in 1996 to attend the University of North Texas and 
get my degree in music.  That first week of concert choir my freshman year, I met the most wonderful girl.  She
walked in the choir room and I said to my friends, "Who is that girl?"  They said, "Oh, that's Brenna Atwood.  
You don't have a chance!"  And they were right. I didn't have a chance. Not that year anyway.

But I started a band, she wanted to sing, and the rest is history.  We eventually started dating, got married, finished school, 
got jobs, had kids, and figured out that Denton, Tx is a really great place to live. 

Every year when the Denton Arts and Jazz Festival roles around, we say, "We should go to that." But something always
comes up and we don't go.  On Saturday's when we drive by the farmers market we say, "Wouldn't it be neet to get up on 
a Saturday morning and check it out." But we have never done it.  It is the same story over and over for the story telling
festival, the dog days of denton, and music on the square.

2015 is going to be different for us.  We are calling it the "Year of Denton" and we are going to finally do what we always say
we should do.  We are going to do as many things Denton as we can.  We are planning from the begining of the year to 
go to the story telling festival and the arts and jazz festival.  We are going to attend the memorial day parade, the 
Forth of July parade, and the UNT Home Coming parade and go to a game at the new Apogee stadium.
